# Intro 

## An AI friend throws me this ðŸ¤–

<b>Stable Diffusion</b> and <b>Midjourney</b> are both generative artificial intelligence models that create images from text prompts. 

Here are some key differences and similarities between them:

<h4>Developer and Release Date:</h4>

- Stable Diffusion was developed by researchers from the CompVis Group at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and Runway with a compute donation by Stability AI. It was released in 20221.

- Midjourney was created and hosted by San Francisco-based independent research lab Midjourney, Inc. It entered open beta on July 12, 20222.

<h4>Technology:</h4>

- Stable Diffusion is a deep learning, text-to-image model based on diffusion techniques. Itâ€™s a latent diffusion model, a kind of deep generative artificial neural network.

- Midjourney also generates images from natural language descriptions, called "prompts".

<h4>Accessibility:</h4>

- Stable Diffusionâ€™s code and model weights have been released publicly, and it can run on most consumer hardware equipped with a modest GPU with at least 8 GB VRAM.

- Midjourney is currently only accessible through a Discord bot on their official Discord server.

<h4>License:</h4>

- Stable Diffusion is available under the Creative ML OpenRAIL-M license.
The software release of Midjourney is not specified in the search results.

<h4>Usage:</h4>

- Stable Diffusion is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions, though it can also be applied to other tasks such as inpainting, outpainting, and generating image-to-image translations guided by a text prompt1.

- Users create artwork with Midjourney using Discord bot commands.
In summary, both Stable Diffusion and Midjourney are powerful tools for generating images from text prompts. They differ mainly in their development, technology, accessibility, and usage.


## Mine version: ðŸ˜¥

- It's free and run locally on Mac M1.
- The community is bigger.
- How's kool it that!
